# Minesweeper Game

This project implements a simple Minesweeper game using the Java programming language. The game is a classic computer game where the user tries to avoid mines by uncovering cells on a minefield.

## Game Features
- The game includes fundamental features such as the game board, mine map, and game state.
- In each turn, the user selects a cell, and if there is a mine in the selected cell, the game is lost.
- When a non-mine cell is selected, the number of mines around that cell is revealed to the user.
- To win the game, the user must select all non-mine cells.
## How to Play
1. The game starts when the user enters the row and column dimensions.
2. Once the data is entered, the game board is displayed for the user.
3. In the first move, the mine map is shown to the user along with a welcome message.
4. The user sequentially selects a cell in each turn.
5. If there is a mine in the selected cell, the game is lost.
6. If there is no mine, the number of mines around the selected cell is revealed.
7. The game is won when all non-mine cells are selected.

## How to Run
